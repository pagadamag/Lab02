            Like many Calgary success stories, ours has a spirited beginning, an
            unprecedentgrowth spurt and a promising future.
          </h1>
          <p>
            Even before Alberta became a province in September 1905, the
            citizens of a very young Calgary were determined to host a
            post-secondary institution as part of building a grcity.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 1906, the Alberta Normal School (which would later become our own
            Werklund School of Education) began operations and provided a steady
            stream of educators for a nprovince eager to grow and advance
            quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            When the University of Alberta was founded in 1908 in Strathcona
            (now part of Edmonton), Calgarians were disappointed with the
            "branch plant" concept that ensued andlobbied for decades for an
            independent institution of their own. Students, faculty, staff,
            alumni, donors and volunteers joined together to support the cause,
            with great passiocommitment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Their dedication was fi nally rewarded on April 29, 1966 when the
            University of Calgary was granted autonomy. From there, growth was
            fast and furious, as a new campus tshape and innovative educators
            came to Calgary from around the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2016-17, the University of Calgary marked its 50th Anniversary as
            an autonomous institution.
